function [spike_count, spikes_rate, event_border] = ss_activity_inday (behave, st, num_bins_in_event)
% The function returns single vector containing the average spike rate of a specific neuron during the trial.
% All trials on that day are averaged and the average is z-scored. 
% The event interval is the time between milstone events such as ITI, Ain, Bin, Bout, etc.
% Inputs:
%    SS_file - The single unite file on a specific day
%    num_bins_in_event - The number of bins that should be used in each interval
%
% Outputs:
%    behave - A struct of the behavioural information in a day
%    st - spike timesS
%    event_border - A vector indicating the border of each interval in bins terms
